## 2023 MMID Bioinformatics Workshop Operation Committee

### Grace E. Seo (Coordinator / Instructor)
Biologist / Master's student
Enteroviruses and Enteric Viruses Laboratory, Viral Diseases Division, Public Health Agency of Canada 
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences University of Manitoba
Email: grace.seo@phac-aspc.gc.ca / seog@myumanitoba.ca
LinkedIN: www.linkedin.com/in/grace-e-seo
&nbsp; 
##### Background
Grace is a 3rd-year master's student supervised by Drs. Tim Booth and Natalie Knox at the National Microbiology Laboratory (Public Health Agency of Canada). Her research involves optimizing whole-genome sequencing protocol for SARS-CoV-2 using nanopore technology for Canada's COVID-19 genomic surveillance program. She uses various bioinformatics tools on BASH and visualize data in RStudio. In her free time, she likes to try out new technology, building websites, coding random stuff and learn other coding languages such as Java and Python.

### Rose Chan (Technology/Webmaster Chair)
Master's Student
Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba
&nbsp; 
##### Background:
Rose is in her 3rd year Master's program. Rose's research interest are viruses, viral-host interaction, and antiviral strategies. Her current thesis project is about developing aptamer, a nucleic acid-based small molecule, for COVID-19 detection and treatment. She is now working under the supervision of Dr. Darwyn Kobasa at the National Microbiology Laboratory. Outside of the lab, she likes to run tabletop games, play badminton, do cooking and listening to music.
