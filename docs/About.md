# What is MMID Bioinformatics Workshop?
Computer coding has arguably become one of the most important skills a researcher needs in science today in order to efficiently conduct large-scale analysis on complex datasets, as well as promote reproducibility, an essential component of any research project.  However, it can be challenging to know where and how to get started.  To take the fear factor out of coding and empower students with the freedom and flexibility to manage their own datasets, the MMID Bioinformatics Workshop was devised.

&nbsp; 
##### Overall, the goals of the MMID Bioinformatics Workshop are as follows:

##### *For Participants:*
1. Learn basic coding languages, such as BASH, R, and Python to promote independence with respect to data exploration, analysis, and visualization, and become more efficient researchers.
&nbsp; 
2. Network with peers and fellow researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds to foster knowledge translation as it pertains to bioinformatics analysis.

&nbsp; 
##### *For Volunteer Instructors:*
1. Gain valuable teaching experience and cultivate/enhance communication and organizational skills.
&nbsp; 
2. Develop an effective teaching style based on constructive feedback received from MMID Bioinformatics Workshop participants.
&nbsp; 
3. Boost self-promotion through sharing lecture materials and conducting workshops that will be made available for future reference on YouTube.
&nbsp; 
4. Become leaders in knowledge dissemination and foster personal growth.

## Workshop updates for 2023
In 2021-2022, Grace and Jill planned and carried out the bioinformatics relevant coding workshops with other graduate student volunteer instructors in the name of MMID Coding Workshop.

With the successful turnout and high demand, this workshop series was reformatted and launched again with the new name, MMID Bioinformatics Workshop. 

&nbsp; 
##### Updates: 
1. MMID Bioinformatics Website now has its independent website hosted on GitHub.
&nbsp; 
2. A new GitHub repository, YouTube, Eventbrite, and email address was created to reflect the new series name.
&nbsp; 
3. From Zoom only workshop, now we offer an in-person Networking Session and workshops with the financial support from the Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Student Council at the University of Manitoba.
